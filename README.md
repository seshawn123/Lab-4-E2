Game Engine Tutorial

Created a counter for Hp and points accumulated over time when clicking the circle. Inspired by the game OSU and AimLabs

1 Found an audio file online
2 Created an empty game object, added the audio source component to it and added the mp4 to it
3 added my respective code to the point text and score text
4 ensure that the audio is only played when clicking the object on screen
